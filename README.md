# Fitness-App

# Project train of thought
 ⋅⋅* This application is written in nodejs as a command line application.
 ⋅⋅* It was a time related decision which I found quite fast to setup.
 ⋅⋅* I tried to break the different requirements of this exercise, to individual functions to give some structure for better readability, understandability and scalability.
 ⋅⋅* The overall assigned to this projects was approximately 2 hours.

 # Future changes
 If I had more time:
 ⋅⋅* I would have changed the running argument to command promt.
 ⋅⋅* I would have changed the argument from case sesitive to case insensitive for better usability.
 ⋅⋅* I would have created test cases to get assured that the solution works for every parameter the user can provide.
 ⋅⋅* I would have transformed the code from JavaScript to typescript to give more structure and readability on the code.
 ⋅⋅* A front-end would have been a nice addition. More specific, a dropdown list populated with the available muscles groups and on select or submit a formatted list with the exercises and other attributes provided from the api to be presented in a more user-friendly format.
